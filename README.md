# laraIRC 🌐

Welcome to `laraIRC`, a super simple web-chat platform inspired by the classic Internet Relay Chat (IRC) experience. `laraIRC` allows users to engage in conversations across multiple channels without the need for any authentication. Jump into a chat by navigating to: https://url.com/channel/CHANNELNAME

This project was initiated as an experiment to explore the rapid development capabilities of [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com) within the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework. It's important to note that `laraIRC` is not intended for production use.

## Features 🚀

- **Multiple Channels**: Engage in conversations across various topics.
- **No Authentication Required**: Start chatting immediately, no sign-up needed.
- **Built with Livewire**: Utilizes the power of Livewire for real-time interactivity.

## Quick Start 🌟

Join a channel instantly by visiting:
`https://url.com/channel/CHANNELNAME`
Replace `CHANNELNAME` with the name of the channel you wish to join.

## Disclaimer 🚧

Please be aware that `laraIRC` is a prototype and not ready for production use. It was created to demonstrate the speed of development with Livewire and Laravel and may lack features necessary for a complete web-chat application.
